Panel Support.

Need to update work area.
Need to listen to panel hints to know where to put the panels.
When panels change, need to retile everything
When a panel is not at an edge, make it floating.

Advantages of the min/max approach 
  -  Get to reuse drop_frame code easily and resize_tiling_frame code easily.

Need to make floating windows not overlap the panels after being moved or resized. 
   -- DONE
