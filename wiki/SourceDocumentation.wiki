#summary Documentation of the source code.

= Introduction =

The source code is documented with Doxygen.  Install Lunchbox and install doxygen and run: {{{ doxygen Doxyfile }}} 

inside the project directory.  This will create a folder called "html" and another called "latex".  Go to the html folder and open "files.html".

Doxygen is a great way to document the implementation details of software projects. [www.doxygen.org]
