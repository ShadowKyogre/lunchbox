= Introduction =

Creating a theme for lunchbox is relatively straight forward.  The first step is to copy an existing theme (such as "original") which can be found in the folder "~/.lunchbox/themes/original" once lunchbox is installed correctly.  Simply copy the whole folder and rename it.  The name of the folder is the identifier of the theme so when you launch Lunchbox to select the theme just write that name after the command. For example to load the minimal theme run:

{{{lunchbox minimal}}}

Each theme contains the following files as a minimum:

{{{
 fonts
 menubar_active.png
 menubar_inactive.png
 menubar_normal.png
 menubar_regions
 popup_menu_active_focussed.png
 popup_menu_active_hover.png
 popup_menu_active.png
 popup_menu_inactive.png
 popup_menu_normal_focussed.png
 popup_menu_normal_hover.png
 popup_menu_normal.png
 popup_menu_regions
 program_frame_active_focussed.png
 program_frame_active.png
 program_frame_inactive.png
 program_frame_normal_focussed.png
 program_frame_normal.png
 program_frame_regions
}}}

To change the appearance of a component in a particular state you can simply edit these image files directly with an image editor provided you don't move or change the width or height of the widgets or the image itself.  For example, to change the way the buttons on all frames look when they are pressed change the "program_frame_active.png" image and the "program_frame_active_focussed.png" image.
The popup menu files provide the background for all the popup menus in Lunchbox and the menu bar files provide the background for the menubar items.

Lunchbox version 0.1 does not support hover mode but future versions will.
Future versions will also allow different windows types to have a different look, so dialog boxes can stand out from other windows and so on.
