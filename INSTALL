Since this is only a beta version I haven't written a full installer and launcher program yet 
but to run it under ubuntu linux, simply copy the themes folder to ~/.lunchbox and then logout, 
login to a "xterm failsafe session" by clicking session on the login screen, cd to wherever
 you extracted the files and run:

./lunchbox minimal &

Then I would suggest opening some normal linux programs from the same window:
(if you need to change between programs after they are open click on the program menu on the bottom LHS).

nautilus &
firefox &


To exit, type exit from the xterm window after closing all the other windows.
